# Program to calculate the sum of two numbers

# Ask the user to input the first number
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Ask the user to input the second number
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum_result}.")
